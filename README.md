# VehicleCrashAnalysis
This project uses Python for crash analytics on Texas traffic data. It features in-depth EDA with pandas and seaborn to find trends. A RandomForestClassifier predicts crash severity, and KMeans clustering identifies high-risk hotspots, visualized in a heatmap. Includes model tuning and performance evaluation.
